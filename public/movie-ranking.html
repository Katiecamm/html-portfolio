<h1>Katie Camm's Top 3 Movies</h1>
<h2>The movies that have made me, shaped me, and changed me for the better</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Moonrise Kingdom</h3>
<p>A lesser appreciated Wes Anderson movie, Moonrise Kingdom captivated my heart and made me feel so seen at a time when I felt so alone. Throughout the years I have found myself time and time again in it's world, with my relationship to it's story and characters evolving as I got older.</p>
<h3>Howl's Moving Castle</h3>
<p>This movie came into my life when I needed it the most. It showed me how someone who truly loves you will treat you, how they will give to you as much as you give to them. I saw a whole other life unfold in front of me. I had hope for myself and my future again, something that had been dead for some time. It changed the course of my life.</p>
<h3>The Iron Giant</h3>
<p>An animated cinematic masterpiece. Instant classic.</p>
